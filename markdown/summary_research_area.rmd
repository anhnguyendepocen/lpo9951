Find one article that uses the same dataset that you have
chosen for your project and review how the authors deal with data
issues such as weights, missing data, cleaning data, recoding, etc. It
will be better if this article concerns a research question similar to
yours, though that is not required.

Submit a 1 to 2 page discussion of what you've found. This is informal,
but show me that you've engaged with the paper that you've choosen.

This is due before class on October 14.
