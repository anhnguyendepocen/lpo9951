Now that you've had a little more time think about your project as well as some
more experience with your dataset, please submit a revised research
question. Use my feedback on your first assignment if you feel
stuck. If you think you got it right the first time, you can resubmit
the same question, but please include a paragraph or two offering
justification.

This is due by class on November 4.
